<h1>Poject: To Automate Manual Reservation Process of Azure Crest Hotel</h1>


<h2>1.Introduction</h2>
Azure Crest Hotel, a 3-star establishment, has relied on a manual process for room reservations involving physical visits or phone calls. This approach is time-consuming, unsecured, prone to errors, contributes to excessive paper usage, and complicates management. The business faces challenges in efficiently handling a high volume of reservations.

<h2>Objectives</h2> 
As a Business Analyst, your role is pivotal in the implementation of an online reservation system designed to achieve the following objectives:

- Develop an efficient online reservation system.
- Eliminate paper-based reservation processes.
- Prevent duplication of customer information.
- Reduce reservation time.
<br />


<h2>Stakeholder Insight</h2> 

- Managing Director: Committed to delivering the automated system within 8 months. Supports the project and has appointed the Hotel Manager as the project sponsor.
- Hotel Manager: Requires a system for customers to search rooms, check prices, make and manage reservations, receive confirmations, and handle payments. Must also empower front office staff for check-ins and check-outs. Room reservations are valid for 1 hour, with free cancellation up to 48 hours before check-in, otherwise, a penalty charge applies.

<h2>2. Project Tasks and Deliverables</h2>
I performed the following tasks to ensure seamless project execution:

<h2>2.3 Process Flow Diagrams and Swim Lanes</h2>
Performed an analysis of the existing manual reservation process, identifying pain points and areas for improvement, 
then utilized BPMN Tools such as MS Visio to create Process Maps
to illustrate the current (AS-IS) and future (TO-BE) business processes.
