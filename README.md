<h1>Poject: To Automate Manual Reservation Process of Azure Crest Hotel</h1>


<h2>1.Introduction</h2>
Azure Crest Hotel, a 3-star establishment, has relied on a manual process for room reservations involving physical visits or phone calls. This approach is time-consuming, unsecured, prone to errors, contributes to excessive paper usage, and complicates management. The business faces challenges in efficiently handling a high volume of reservations.

<h2>Objectives</h2> 
As a Business Analyst, your role is pivotal in the implementation of an online reservation system designed to achieve the following objectives:

- Develop an efficient online reservation system.
- Eliminate paper-based reservation processes.
- Prevent duplication of customer information.
- Reduce reservation time.
<br />


<h2>Stakeholder Insight</h2> 

- Managing Director: Committed to delivering the automated system within 8 months. Supports the project and has appointed the Hotel Manager as the project sponsor.
- Hotel Manager: Requires a system for customers to search rooms, check prices, make and manage reservations, receive confirmations, and handle payments. Must also empower front office staff for check-ins and check-outs. Room reservations are valid for 1 hour, with free cancellation up to 48 hours before check-in, otherwise, a penalty charge applies.

<h2>Project Task</h2>
I carried out the following 12 tasks to ensure seamless project execution:

- I prepared a High-level project plan to guide project management activities.
- RACI matrix to define stakeholders roles and responsibilities.
- Gap Analysis to understand current state and develop strategies for improvement.
- Utilized BPMN Tools like MS Vision to map Business Process that clearly defined current and future states of the business.
- Use Case Diagram and accompanying documentation to show the end-users interactions with the system.
- Functional and Non-Functional Requirement Documents to communicate the system specifications to the developers.
- Created a Prototypes of the online system to simulate UI interactions and functionalities 
- User Stories and defined Acceptance Criteria to describe the end-users requirements to the developers.
- Business Requirement Document to communicate the project objectives to the stakeholders 
- A comprehensive Test Plan for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and ensure that the solution meets the business requirements.
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to track defects that was identified after testing.
- Designed an effective Defect Management Document to track and address issues before deployment.
