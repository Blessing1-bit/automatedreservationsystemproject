<h1>Poject: To Automate Manual Reservation Process of Azure Crest Hotel</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
Azure Crest Hotel, a 3-star establishment operates on manual process for room reservations. Customers either physically visit or call the hotel to secure room reservations. This manual approach is fraught with several challenges:

- Time-Consuming:The manual process is notably time-intensive, causing delays and inconvenience for both customers and staff
- Unsecured and Unreliable: Manual reservations lack the security and reliability that modern technology can provide, making them prone to errors.
- Excessive Paper Usage: The current method contributes to excessive paper consumption for reservation records.
- Complex Management: The management faces difficulties in efficiently managing a high volume of room reservation requests, making tracking customer bookings cumbersome.

<h2>Objectives</h2> 
As a Business Analyst, your role is pivotal in the implementation of an online reservation system designed to achieve the following objectives:

- Develop an efficient online hotel reservation system to enhance hospitality management.
- Eliminate the reliance on paper-based reservation processes.
- Remove the duplication of customer information in the booking process.
- Significantly reduce the time required for making reservations.

I carried out the following tasks to be to execute this project successfully:

- I prepared a High-level project plan to guide project management activities.
- RACI matrix to define stakeholders roles and responsibilities.
- Gap Analysis to understand current state and develop strategies for improvement.
- Utilized BPMN Tools like MS Vision to map Business Process that clearly defined current and future states of the business.
- Use Case Diagram and accompanying documentation to show the end-users interactions with the system.
- Functional and Non-Functional Requirement Documents to communicate the system specifications to the developers.
- User Stories and defined Acceptance Criteria to describe the end-users requirements to the developers.
- Business Requirement Document to communicate the project objectives to the stakeholders 
- A comprehensive Test Plan for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and ensure that the solution meets the business requirements.
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to track defects that was identified after testing.
